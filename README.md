# Java 8 Bench

`java8bench` is creatd for presentation purpose. 
Boiler plate code is generated by JMH (microbenchmark library in OpenJDK) maven archetype.

## Usage

It's dead simple. Just run MyBench class to see console output for throughput / response time. 

There are number of reasons you do not create your own benchmark framework. 

- Java HotSpot VM is smart enough to compile "hotspot". ode runs on interpreter first, and "hotspot" is dynamically compiled.
- JVM is smart enough to bypass unused code. i.e. all the loops that returns are unused.
